# Contribute

The Wanswap documentation is built using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), and makes use of the [docsify-themeable](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/) theming system. 

In order to contribute to the docs, fork the original [repo](https://github.com/wanswap/wanswap-docs), make changes locally, commit and push changes to your fork, and finally submit a pull request in order to merge your changes and get them pushed live. After submitting a pull request, please check to see if your request was accepted. Requests will generally be accepted within a few days. If your request is not accepted, check the comments to see what you need to modify to get your request accepted.Leland

## Prerequisites

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Most NodeJS installs include [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), if your version does not include NPM, make sure to install that as well.

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. [Add ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to your GitHub account.

1. Familiarize yourself with [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

### 2. Set up for editing

You may either edit locally on your own machine or edit directly on GitHub.

**OPTION A - Clone locally:**  

1. From your terminal, `cd` into the directory of your choice and clone your forked version locally:

> `git clone https://github.com/{your usernam}/FinNexus-Documentation.git`

2. Open the project using a text editor of your choice. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is very popular, while [Typora](https://typora.io/) is an excellent choice for editing Markdown.

3. Install Docsify CLI from terminal:

> `npm i docsify-cli -g`

4. From inside the project directory, run local dev server to preview changes:

> `docsify serve docs`

5. Preview the website at URL shown in the terminal output. The URL is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default, but will be assigned a different URL if that one is already in use.

When you are satisfied with your changes, input the following git commands:

$ git commit -m "Write a message describing your changes"
$ git push
```

Using Markdown syntax, add new content to the file of your choice:
