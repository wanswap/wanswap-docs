Enter the amount needed, and then click the Next button.

On the cross-chain transaction confirmation page, after verifying that the information is correct, click the Send button.

### Step 4: Check transfer status

In the transfer history, you can find the status of the cross-chain transaction,
and wanEOS will be displayed in the receiving address when the processes is completed.

There are several normal statuses:
• Lock request sent
• Lock request has been executed (this may take a little longer to wait for block confirmation on the EOS network)
• Locked
• Redemption request sent
• Success
