wanBTC is the converted format of BTC on Wanchain, so actually wanBTC address is the same to WAN address.

Select your wanBTC address from the itme To(Wanchain) in WanWallet.

Type the amount of bitcoins you want to convert, and click Next.

Note: You need to both have sufficient BTC and WAN on your sender address and receiver address for the Gas fees on both chains. Otherwise, the cross-chain transfer may fail due to insufficient balance.
