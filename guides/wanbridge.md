# How to Use WanBridge - The Cross-Chain Bridge of Wanchain



### **What is WanBridge?**

WanBridge is the browser-based interface for Wanchain cross-chain transactions between Wanchain and Ethereum. With WanBridge, you no longer need to download and install the WanChain desktop light wallet. Simply go to the [WanBridge website](https://bridge.wanchain.org/) and make sure you have the [WanMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wanmask/omnkcjdohbnjfjmlaiboojplahajnenj) and [MetaMask ](https://metamask.io/)browser extension wallets installed. WanBridge currently officially supports only Google Chrome, but other browsers which have Chrome extensions may also work.

## 2. Select Asset

On the next page, find the type of asset you want to convert and click the “Convert” button on the right to start the cross-chain operation.

Use the filter box in the upper right corner to filter asset types.

Let’s take “MKR - Ethereum <-> Wanchain” as an example. This will wrap MKR so it’s usable on Wanchain, or unwrap MKR that’s on Wanchain back to Ethereum.

Then click “Add to Chrome” to start the installation;

Click the Connect MetaMask button.

## 4. Convert operation

After the two wallets are connected, you set up the bridge. At this time, the page displays the asset type and conversion direction you selected, as well as the addresses you selected.

Now choose the address you are sending from and the receiving address. In this case that it will be MetaMask in the ‘From’ field and WanMask in the ‘To’ field.

Check your cross-chain transaction information again, click the “Start” or “Approve” button after confirming that it is correct. If this is the first transaction for this asset, you need to authorize the asset first. Your wallet will popup to confirm this. You will see a higher gas fee than you eventually pay, this is because gas fees on ETH can fluctuate heavily and it’s not possible to give the exact cost upfront. The actual cost for approving transaction was $13.16.

After authorization is successful, click the “Start” button.

At this time, it will connect to the sender’s wallet, WanMask or MetaMask will pop up for you to authorize the transaction. You will see a higher gas fee than you eventually pay, this is because gas fees on ETH can fluctuate heavily and it’s not possible to give the exact cost upfront. You can see the gas fee in the picture says $64.13 but in the end, it only cost $26.43. It’s also possible to edit the gas fees by clicking on the ‘Edit’ button.

After the authorization is confirmed, the cross-chain transaction has been submitted to the chain. At this time, you only need to wait for a while, and the cross-chain assets will arrive in your account soon.
