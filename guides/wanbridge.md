# WanBridge simple operation steps

What is WanBridge?

WanBridge is the browser based interface for Wanchain cross-chain transactions between Wanchain and Ethereum. With WanBridge, you no longer need to download and install the WanChain desktop light wallet. Simply go to the [WanBridge website](https://bridge.wanchain.org) and make sure you have the [WanMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wanmask/omnkcjdohbnjfjmlaiboojplahajnenj) and [MetaMask ](https://metamask.io/)browser extension wallets installed. WanBridge currently officially supports only Google Chrome, but other browser which run Chrome extensions may also work.
