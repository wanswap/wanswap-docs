- Now scroll all the way down and click 'Save'.

### Finding out transaction nonce

Now we need the pending transaction nonce, you can find all stuck transactions on [this](https://wanchain-txpool.vercel.app/) page. Check for your transaction and note the nonce number.

### Submitting an empty transaction

- Open the WanMask extension
